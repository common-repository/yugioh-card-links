== Description ==

The goal of the TCGplayer.com Plug-in is to provide an instantaneous way for you to turn all Yu-Gi-Oh! card names within your blog posts into card information links with Hi-Mid-Low pricing! You never need to highlight a card name and hit a button over and over again. Just type up your entire post and then click the "Card Parse Article" button. All Yugioh card names are instantly turned into links that have a hover effect showing the card image and its current Hi-Mid-Low price from the internets cheapest vendors!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole "yugioh-card-links" directory to your "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the "Card Parse Article" in the editor.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the minimum PHP version? =

This plugin requires PHP 5.0.0 or later.

= How long does parsing a text for card names take? =

This depends a lot on your server and the total length of the text you are parsing but is usually a few seconds.
Once parsing is finished all card names will be transformed into links.
Please refrain from changing the text while it is being parsed for card names.
